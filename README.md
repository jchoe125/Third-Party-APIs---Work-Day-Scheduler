# Third-Party-APIs---Work-Day-Scheduler

**Homework #05**

**Objectives**
* For this week, our goal was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

* The moment library was utilized to work with date and time and the user is able to add events to the planner into set hour timeblocks. Based on the time of day, the timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. The data persists when the page is refreshed.

**Requirements**
* Screenshots:
  
* The URL of the deployed application

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project
